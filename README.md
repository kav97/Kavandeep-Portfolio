# Kav Johal - My Portfolio

## Hello everyone! I approached this project using strictly what I have been taught so far: HTML & SCSS. *See image below* 

    Firstly, I broke down the content of the page into 6 sections:
    - Navigation
    - Title section
    - Portfolio
    - About me
    - Contact
    - Footer

- I then started writing up section-by-section the HTML & SCSS needed to create this project. To understand how it all worked/ linked together I've used BEM notation throughout my work.
